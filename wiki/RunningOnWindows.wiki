#summary Foo-YC20 on Windows

= Foo YC20 VST =

The easiest way to use the Foo YC20 organ is to use the included VST plugin (FooYC20.dll). You can integrate the plugin into a host of your choosing and have the organ running in your sequencer etc. The plugin does _not include the graphical user interface_. It is being worked on an hopefully will be included in later versions.

However, due to the nature of the organ processing, it is worth noting that the VST plugin uses a lot of CPU power. This is regardless of whether it is playing sounds or not.

= Standalone JACK version =

The release also contains a JACK application. JACK is a handy mechanism to route audio to and from applications. This allows patching together a virtual studio from separate audio programs. The standalone application also contains a GUI which imitates the (red) Yamaha YC20.

Note. There is a headless command line version for those who do not want or need the GUI.

To use the standalone version, you must first install jack and then have it running before starting the application. You need a bit of dedication to take this route, so it is not recommended for the faint of heart

== Installing JACK ==

Jack is available to download at [http://jackaudio.org/download the jack website]. The _tgz_ file is a package which contains an installer in the bin/windows directory. That will install jack and a graphical user interface you can use to control and set up jack (Jack Control). Using the control panel included in the 1.9.6 release is a bit tricky but later versions should make it easier.

A tutorial on how to set up jack in Windows is greatly appreciated.

== Jack and MIDI ==

The Foo YC20 jack application uses Jack to route midi to it. As it stands, setting up MIDI support in Jack is quite difficult in Windows. This makes playing the standalone organ quite difficult and is a further reason why at this point in time, the VST is in practice the only sane option in Windows.
