This is a Faust implementation of a 1969 designed Yamaha combo organ, the YC-20. In addition to 
the Faust code, there is a Gtkmm UI with Jack audio and midi support. A LV2 instrument plugin is
planned but not yet executed.

The MIDI implementation does not care about midi channels. As Jack MIDI offers flexible routing, 
there is little need to filter messages based on midi channel. Please contact the author if this
becomes a real problem though.

MIDI can be used to play the emulation, but also control the parameters. Here's the CC map:
